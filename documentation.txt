# Documentation for Financial Bot Colab Notebook

## Overview
The Financial Bot Colab Notebook is designed to process and analyze financial documents efficiently using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It employs FAISS for fast similarity search, SentenceTransformers for text embeddings, and pdfplumber for extracting text and tables from PDF files. This makes it ideal for document retrieval and interactive financial analysis.

## Features
- **PDF Processing**: Extracts text and tables from uploaded PDF files.
- **Text Embedding**: Generates embeddings using `SentenceTransformers`.
- **Document Search**: Utilizes FAISS for efficient similarity-based search.
- **NLP Query Handling**: Implements a pipeline from Hugging Face Transformers to process user queries.
- **Colab Integration**: Supports easy file uploads and interactive execution.

## Dependencies
To use this notebook, the following Python libraries are required:
```python
import faiss
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import pdfplumber
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from io import BytesIO
from google.colab import files
from transformers import pipeline
```

## Installation
If running locally, install the required dependencies using:
```bash
pip install faiss-cpu sentence-transformers pdfplumber pandas numpy transformers
```

## How to Use
### 1. Open the Notebook
- Upload the notebook to Google Colab.
- Ensure that runtime settings are configured correctly.

### 2. Upload PDF Files
- Use Google Colabâ€™s file upload feature to add financial documents.

### 3. Extract and Process Content
- Run the cells to extract text and tables from the PDFs.
- Generate text embeddings for document retrieval.

### 4. Perform Similarity Search
- Use FAISS to search for relevant text segments based on user queries.

### 5. Query Processing with NLP
- Run the transformers-based pipeline to answer questions based on document content.

## Example Usage
1. **Uploading a PDF**
   ```python
   uploaded = files.upload()
   pdf_path = list(uploaded.keys())[0]
   ```
2. **Extracting Text**
   ```python
   with pdfplumber.open(pdf_path) as pdf:
       text = "\n".join([page.extract_text() for page in pdf.pages if page.extract_text()])
   ```
3. **Generating Embeddings**
   ```python
   model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   embeddings = model.encode(text)
   ```
4. **Performing Search**
   ```python
   index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
   index.add(embeddings)
   ```
